## Description ##

Progressive Web Apps (PWA) in WordPress depend on the following technologies to be available:

* [Service Workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) (see [#36995](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/36995))
* [Web App Manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) (see [#43328](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/43328))
* HTTPS (see [#28521](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/28521))

This plugin is intended to serve as a place to implement support for these in WordPress with the intention of being proposed for core merge, piece by piece.
